How to integrate agricultural data using data shapes
======

About this book
---------------

This book illustrates and explains a method for integrating agricultural data of diverse types, from diverse sources, and in diverse formats, for the purpose of scientific analysis.

This method is being applied in NAL Shapes, a project of the USDA National Agricultural Library (NAL) in collaboration with the [WESO Research Group](https://www.weso.es/) of the University of Oviedo, Spain. Project team members who have contributed to this book are [Andra Waagmeester](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q19845625), [Katherine Thornton](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q41533116), [Jose Emilio Labra Gayo](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q51602692), [Eric Prud'hommeaux](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q28914639), [Josh Moore](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4028-811X), [Tom Baker](http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3741-6977), and [Jennifer Woodward-Greene](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3236-2711). 

This book is an ["executable book"](https://jupyterbook.org/) -- a publication form that integrates example data with relevant schemas and executable code. It is intended to serve as a "living book" -- one that will grow with new examples and code snippets that readers of this book will be able to adapt for their own analytical goals.
