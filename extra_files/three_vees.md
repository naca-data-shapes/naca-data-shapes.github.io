The term big data has emerged to name data that is so large and complex that traditional data processing applications canâ€™t handle it. Big data has been described by at least three words starting by V: volume, velocity, variety. Although volume and velocity are the most visible features, variety is a key concern which prevents data integration and generates lots of interoperability problems.
