Data Shape
  A description of the terms, modeling patterns, and constraints required or expected to be found in data - also known as a schema. Shape schemas are expressed in shape languages such as <<shex>> and are typically used to validate data consistency or, in the <<NAL Shapes>> project, to express a target schema to which data from multiple sources and in a diversity of formats can be normalized.

NALT Concept Space (NALT)
  Originally created in the 1980s as the National Agricultural Library Thesaurus, a hierarchically structured keyword authority for indexing agricultural research, NALT has evolved into an authority of concepts, each with its own cloud of keywords. This set of concepts is subdivided into overlapping [concept schemes](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer). Taken as a whole, this set of concept schemes consititute the [NALT Concept Space](https://agclass.nal.usda.gov/). NALT concepts can be used as keywords or properties for constructing <<data shapes>> in <<ShEx>>. NALT is expressed in <<SKOS>>, on the basis of <<RDF>>, and published as <<linked data>>. Many of concepts are mapped to equivalent concepts in other authorities relevant to agriculture, such as [AGROVOC](http://fao.org/agrovoc/), [CABI Thesaurus](https://www.cabi.org/cabthesaurus/), and [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/).

Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
  URIs identify "anything", ranging from Web pages (URLs), real-world things such as people (eg ORCID URIs), and the <<RDF>> properties and classes of <<Linked Data>>, to the "concepts" of resources such as <<NALT>>. Concept URIs may be used to denote purely conceptual things (eg "applied resource"), properties of things ("staple length"), or things in the real world ("apples"). URIs are made globally unique by using well-supported prefixes, or "schemes", such as "http" and "https". URIs maintained by organizations that can guarantee their semantic stability and long-term availability, such as <<NALT>> URIs maintained by the National Agricultural Library, are referred to as persistent URIs. The use of persistent URIs in data can help ensure that data will remain useful in the longer-term future.
