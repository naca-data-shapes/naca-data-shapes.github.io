About this book
---------------

This book illustrates and explains the methodology used by NAL Shapes, a project of the USDA National Agricultural Library (NAL) to facilitate the integration of agricultural data of diverse types, from diverse sources, and in diverse formats, for the purpose of scientific analysis. The project has been undertaken in collaboration with the [WESO Research Group](https://www.weso.es/) of the [University of Oviedo](), Spain. Project team members who have contributed to this book are [Andra Waagmeester](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q19845625), [Katherine Thornton](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q41533116), [Jose Emilio Labra Gayo](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q51602692), [Eric Prud'hommeaux](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q28914639),

[Do we want to distinguish project leaders?] The book has been prepared as an ["executable book"](https://jupyterbook.org/), 
a publication form that integrates example data with relevant schemas and running code. This is also intended to serve as a "living book" -- one that will grow with new examples and code snippets that readers of this book will be able to adapt for their own analytical goals.
