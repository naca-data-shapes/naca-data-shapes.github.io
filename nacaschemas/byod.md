"Bring Your Own Data" (BYOD) workshops
======================================
# Bring together domain experts and data experts
Data management is often perceived as the responsibility of data experts or computer experts.
However, domain experts are equally important, if not more important, in the process of developing data shapes. 
Domain experts are the experts on the data and the data use cases. They are the ones that know the data and the data use cases best.

Bring Your Own Data (BYOD) workshops can be instrumental in bringing together a mutlidisciplinary team of domain experts and data experts.
These workshops can be organized in a variety of ways. The most important aspect is that the domain experts and the data experts are brought together in a room and that they are given the opportunity to work together on the data and the data use cases.
The room can also be a virtual room. The first data shape - on the topic of research surrounding cotton - was developed in a virtual BYOD workshop.
Over the span of a few months a team of experts on both cotton data and data shapes, met bi-weekly in online zoom meetings to develop the data shape.
The meetings were organized in such a way that the domain experts were given the opportunity to explain the data and the data use cases to the data experts.
