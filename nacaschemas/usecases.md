Identify the use cases
======================
# The example of linking data on cotton, weather and soil
Cotton is selected as the first Project Demonstration Topic (PDT). Different data sources as well as
domain experts were identified. The domain experts were invited to a series of online meetings. During these 
meetings we have identified the following use cases:
1. Linking cotton data to weather and soil data. 
2. Linking cotton data to align pre-ginning and post-ginning data.

The first use case is described in more detail in the remainder of this chapter. 

## Synthetic data
The process of identifying and suitable data sources to create to create linked data on cotton, weather and soil is still ongoing.
There is much data available on cotton, weather and soil. However, the data is not always available in a format that is (yet) suitable for linking.
To be able to create sensible datasets for the effective application of data shapes more data is needed, especially data that aligns. 
The currently available data might already be suitable, but the alignment and necessary granularity is not immediatly visible. 

To over come this problem we have created synthetic data sets. These synthetic data sets are created for the sole purpose of 
demonstrating the use of data shapes. The modeling efforts are still ongoing and future versions of this book will include examples of
read data.

### TODO: Create links to the synthetic data sets made by Eric.
