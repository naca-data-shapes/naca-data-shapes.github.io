Wikidata
==========
[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) is a public domain knowledge graph that is maintained by the Wikimedia Foundation. 
Together with Wikipedia, Wikipedia and other community driven project, Wikidata forms the Wikimedia ecosystem. We mention
Wikidata here, not only because it is very active and rich platform that can provide links to explore other data sources, but also
because it is a rich resource for examples of linked data. A substantial amount of NALT concepts are already linked to Wikidata.
Because this alone, Wikidata can be used as a teaching resource for the NACA Data Shapes project.

The following sections provide various examples of data related to Nalt, Cotton, Weather and Soil. The examples are provided in
the form results snippets of SPARQL queries.
